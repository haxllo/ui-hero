## How to Customize Copy

### Step 1: Identify Your Audience's Pain
- Are they non-technical founders? (Focus on "no code required")
- Are they developers? (Focus on "clean code, zero dependencies")
- Are they designers? (Focus on "production-ready components")

### Step 2: Pick Your Primary Benefit
- Speed? → "Ship in 30 minutes"
- Quality? → "Look like you raised $5M"
- Ease? → "No design skills required"
- Trust? → "Join 500+ founders"

### Step 3: Match Copy to Benefit
If speed is primary:
- Headline: "Ship Your Landing Page This Weekend"
- Subheadline: "30 minutes from download to deployed"
- CTA: "Start Building Now"

If quality is primary:
- Headline: "Make Your AI Startup Look Funded"
- Subheadline: "Professional sections that build instant trust"
- CTA: "Get Premium Sections"

### Step 4: Test & Iterate
- Launch with one version
- Track conversion rate
- Try new copy after 100 visitors
- Compare results
- Keep what works

## Final Checklist

Before you publish:
- [ ] Every headline answers "So what?"
- [ ] Benefits > Features in all descriptions
- [ ] No jargon or buzzwords
- [ ] Specific numbers (30 min, $39, 500+ users)
- [ ] Clear call-to-action on every section
- [ ] Emotional hook in hero section
- [ ] Proof in social proof section
- [ ] Urgency without fake scarcity

---

**Remember:** Copy that converts is copy that focuses on the customer's outcome, not your product's features.

People don't buy landing sections.  
They buy **confidence, speed, and credibility**.

Sell the outcome, not the code.
