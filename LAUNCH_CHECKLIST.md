## Common Launch Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This
1. **Overthinking pre-launch** - Ship fast, iterate later
2. **Pricing too low** - $39 is reasonable, don't go lower
3. **No payment processor ready** - Set up Gumroad BEFORE launch
4. **Ignoring feedback** - Reply to every customer
5. **Not building in public** - Share your journey on Twitter
6. **Expecting instant success** - It takes 2-4 weeks to gain traction
7. **Giving up too early** - Most products take 3-6 months to find PMF

### ✅ Do This Instead
1. **Launch in 2 weeks max** - Speed beats perfection
2. **Charge money from day 1** - Free users don't validate anything
3. **Be authentic** - Share the real story, struggles, wins
4. **Respond fast** - First 10 customers make or break momentum
5. **Build authority** - Share landing page tips even without sales
6. **Stay consistent** - Post 2-3x per week minimum
7. **Track everything** - Google Analytics, sales, traffic sources

---

## Emergency Kit

### If Sales Are Slow
1. Offer early-bird discount (24-48 hours only)
2. Do 5 free 1-on-1 landing page reviews on Twitter
3. Share before/after examples using UI Hero
4. Post section code snippets as free value
5. Write "How to validate your AI idea with a landing page"

### If Tech Issues
1. Keep staging environment for testing
2. Monitor Vercel deployment logs
3. Have rollback plan (previous git commit)
4. Set up status page (even simple one)
5. Email customers immediately if downtime >1hr

### If Negative Feedback
1. Don't take it personally
2. Ask what they expected instead
3. Offer refund immediately if unhappy
4. Fix valid issues within 48h
5. Turn critics into testimonials after fix
